  In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
  <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
  However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
  <strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.

  10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
</h2>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1rem", fontWeight: "600" }}>
  Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
  At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
  California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
